*I am an associate research scholar in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University.  
I am in transition to School of Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University as an associate professor.*

Performance of our modeling platform  
======
Our modeling platform showed great performance not only in the [ParFlow hydrologic modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169423012362), but also showed favorable performance in the EcoSLIM particle tracking.

**Simulated groundwater ages compare favorably to that reported in literatures and expand these previous understandings by a more complete age distribution of all aquifers and wider simulated ranges of individual aquifers.** **(a)** shows locations of the 21 principal aquifers studied in *Jurgens et al. (2022)*. Simulated groundwater age distribution **(b)** agrees with that based on means of 1279 samples from *Jurgens et al. (2022)* (measured) at peak ages. The latter cannot capture the distribution of groundwater age at large values due to the limited number of samples. The average age of 14 macroscale basins summarized in *Stewart et al. (2010)* is also indicated by the shaded grey line in **(b)**. Peak ages of three different data sources match each other well. **(c)** presents the age range of each aquifer bracketed by minimum age and maximum age with the mean value indicated. Lines and bars are for simulated and *Jurgens et al. (2022)*, respectively. Simulated means compare well with that reported in *Jurgens et al. (2022)* and simulated ranges bracket the reported ranges showing the expanded understandings.
