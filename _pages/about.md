**I am an associate research scholar at Princeton University.  
I am in transition to Sun Yat-sen University as an associate professor.**

Research directions
======
**Multi-GPU, CUDA-Aware acceleration of particle tracking on distributed platforms**  
[EcoSLIM CUDA backend](https://github.com/aureliayang/EcoSLIM_CONUS) 

**Large-scale hydrologic modeling: National hydrologic modeling platform of China**  
[ParFlow China](https://github.com/aureliayang/EcoSLIM_CONUS) 

**Data-driven approach in hydrology: Neural particle tracking using Neural ODE**  
[*X*EcoSLIM](https://github.com/aureliayang/XEcoSLIM)  

**Application of hydrologic models for scientific discoveries**  
* Topography-controls on spatiotemporal variations of ET age
  * Particle tracking in the North China Plain
* Connections between groundwater and streamflow
  * Backward partilce tracking in the continental USA  
  * The following figure shows the convincing performance of our modeling platform.
